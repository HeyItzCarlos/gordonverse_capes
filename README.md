This was made to make use of capes and skins on "The Gordonverse" Sever.

Description
# Minecraft Skin Server for Github

This is a setup "template" for a Minecraft skin server hosted right here on Github.  
It uses the [OfflineSkins mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/offlineskins-fabric) for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net), which by default grab skins from Crafatar or a local folder but can also be configured to use practically any HTTP server.


To use this, install the mod and put the `offlineskins.json` file into your `.minecraft/config`. Clone the repository to your own account, upload your skins (and capes!) named by your username, and change the URL username & repo in the config file to your own.  
No setup on your offline Minecraft server is required whatsoever.
